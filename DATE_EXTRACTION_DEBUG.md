# Date Extraction Debug Analysis

## Problem
The `lastEventDate` is showing as `null` even though we're processing 1200 events successfully.

## Investigation
Looking at the event creation code in `getEventsFromResponse()`:

```javascript
// date extraction from API response
const { datesFormatted: { dateTitle, dateSubTitle }, dates: { localDate, dateTBA, timeTBA } } = item;

// final event object includes localDate
const event = {
    ...{ dateTitle, dateSubTitle, localDate, dateTBA, timeTBA },
    // ... other fields
};
```

## Possible Issues
1. **API Response Format**: The API might not always provide `localDate` in the expected format
2. **Date Parsing**: Some events might have `localDate` as null/undefined
3. **Array Processing**: The last event in the array might not have a valid date

## Solution Applied
Enhanced the date extraction logic to:
1. First try `localDate` (preferred format)
2. Fallback to `dateTitle` if available
3. Log warnings if no suitable date is found
4. Provide detailed logging for debugging

## Next Steps
Need to run a test to see the actual event structure and determine why `localDate` might be null for some events.

## Test Configuration
Created `test-debug-date.json` with limited `maxItems: 200` to complete quickly and verify date extraction works.
