# State Tracking Fix for Continuation Mode

## Problem
The actor was successfully scraping 1200 events but the final state was showing 0 events scraped because the state wasn't being properly persisted.

## Root Cause
The state was only being saved to the crawler's internal state using `context.crawler.useState()`, but this doesn't persist to the Actor's key-value store. When `main.js` tried to read the final state after crawling completed, it couldn't access the updated state properly.

## Solution
1. **Enhanced State Persistence**: Modified `events-crawler.js` to save state to both:
   - Crawler internal state: `context.crawler.useState(newState)`  
   - Actor key-value store: `Actor.setValue('CRAWLER_STATE', newState)`

2. **Updated State Reading**: Modified `main.js` to read state from:
   - Primary: Actor key-value store `Actor.getValue('CRAWLER_STATE')`
   - Fallback: Crawler state `eventsCrawler.useState()`

3. **Defensive Logging**: Added null-safe logging with `|| 0` for undefined values

## Files Modified
- `src/routes/events-crawler.js`: Added `Actor.setValue('CRAWLER_STATE', state)` calls
- `src/main.js`: Updated state reading and added defensive logging

## Expected Behavior After Fix
The final logs should now show:
```
Total events scraped: 1200
Last event date processed: [actual date]
```

Instead of:
```
Total events scraped: 0
Last event date processed: null
```

## Test Configuration
Created `test-state-tracking.json` with:
- `maxItems: 600` (to complete before API limit)
- `continuationMode: true` (to enable state tracking)
- `autoContinue: true` (for full continuation support)

This ensures we can verify the state tracking without hitting API limits.
